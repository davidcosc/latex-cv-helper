# LaTeX-CV-Helper

## Requirements
- A tex engine like [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension (recommended)
- Image size of 567 x 622 pixels to ensure sections on the left page align to the right page (recommended) (optionally u have to add whitespace as required yourself)

## Usage
See the [cv-example.tex](./cv-example.tex) file. For your own project simply clone the repository and rename and adjust the example according to your needs.
If you set up VS Code as recommended, editing the example in VS Code and saving it should trigger a rebuild of the PDF automatically.
